# Coffee Shop Full Stack

Udacity has decided to open a new digitally enabled cafe for students to order drinks, socialize, and study hard. But they need help setting up their menu experience.

Function requirements:

1) Display graphics representing the ratios of ingredients in each drink.
2) Allow public users to view drink names and graphics.
3) Allow the shop baristas to see the recipe information.
4) Allow the shop managers to create new drinks and edit existing drinks.

## About the Stack

This stack provides proper permission based on your roles using auth0. Visitors can view drink names while shop baristas can view detailed recipe. For managers, they can create drinks and edit recipes.
